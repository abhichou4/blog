Hi, I'm Abhineet. I'm a final year Computer Science student.

I like to use __NoobMaster__ as my nom-de-net. Apart from the deceleration "I'm no expert at this", it reminds me how you can study something for long and know so little about it. That's precisely the objective of this blog. I'll visited or re-visit topics from the perspective of a noob, and write about it for my own learning process, but if it helps
someone out there, great!

You can find my resume [on my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhineet-c-344967bb/).
